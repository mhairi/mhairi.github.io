        <h2>Travel to Shetland</h2>

        <p>We both appreciate that travelling to Shetland can be difficult and expensive, and we completely understand if you cannot make the trip. If you do decide to travel up, here is our advice.</p>
        <p>You have two options to get to Shetland: flying or boat. Both have advantages and disadvantages.</p>

        <h3>Flying</h3>
        <p>Flying is more expensive, but much faster. There are regular flights from Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow available from the <a href="https://www.loganair.co.uk/" target="_blank">Loganair website</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The flights are generally cheaper the earlier you book, so we recommend booking early.</li>
            <li>Aberdeen flights are normally less expensive; you may save money travelling to Aberdeen and flying from there.</li>
            <li>Apart from the price, the other disadvantage of flying is that it is less reliable. Flights often get delayed or cancelled for poor weather.</li>
            <li>March is probably one of the better months for flying, but we recommend arriving early if you can and accepting you may get home a day late.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Boat</h3>
        <p>There is a ferry that sails from Aberdeen every night and arrives in Shetland the next morning (<a href="https://www.northlinkferries.co.uk/" target="_blank">Northlink Ferries</a>).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This will almost certainly be cheaper than the plane and will definitely be cheaper if you don't have a cabin (not necessarily recommended!).</li>
            <li>It takes between 12 to 14 hours, and can be rough.</li>
            <li>Bookings for 2025 should open in November, you can sign up for notifications <a href="https://www.northlinkferries.co.uk/booking-info/2025-bookings/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li>We recommend booking as early as you can. Not because the prices go up, but because cabins and space for cars can sell out, particularly in the Summer. March should be okayish, but it's hard to say.</li>
            <li>The boat is definitely more dependable than flying, but still can get cancelled due to weather. Again, March should be okay, but you can never really say for sure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Taking / Renting a Car</h3>
        <p>You definitely do not need a car for the wedding. We'll have a bus that goes from the main town to the venue. However if you want to do some sightseeing a car is useful.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is public transport, but it's not that frequent.</li>
            <li>If you want to take your own car you can do that on the Northlink ferry.</li>
            <li>Depending on how long you are staying for it may be cheaper to rent a car on the island.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accommodation</h3>
        <p>Accommodation can be expensive and can sell out in advance. There is a lot of accommodation in the main town, Lerwick, and the bus will take you to and from the wedding. The <a href="https://www.hostellingscotland.org.uk/hostels/lerwick/" target="_blank">youth hostel</a> is affordable and we have heard it is nice.</p>
